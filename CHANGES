    Improved rewriting for pages with JavaScript:
    - Don't rewrite href="javascript:XXX" links or text inside them
    - Change the way forms are re-written, so that JavaScript won't fail.

    Use link indices as well as names (supports multiple links of the
    same name on a single page).

    Preserve page titles.

    Use form names when available, rather than form numbers.

    Keep attributes in their original order on rewrite.

    Support links with quotes (") in them.

    Only try to rewrite text/ content (images, etc. won't be
    corrupted).
